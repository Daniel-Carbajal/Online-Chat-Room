# Online-Chat-Room
This is a simple personal project I worked on that utilizes Flask and SocketIO in Python for an online chatroom. This was also my first time using CSS for styling. For the styling, I followed an @techwithtim tutorial! 
This project utilizes Python, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS

# app.py


# templates
  ## base.html
  
  ## home.html
  
  ## room.html

# static(CSS Styling)
This was my first time doing any CSS, so I was unfamiliar with the language and its uses. I followed a @techwithtim YouTube tutorial and got somewhat familiar with how it can be utilized to style website visuals and format!
